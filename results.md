### Results

This project takes a look into into US Foreign Aid delivery and distribution since 1946. Key results show support for academic understandings of foreign aid, as one being shaped by national interests. Like so, US foreign aid in its largest proportion was and has been directed to key strategic alies (Western Europe, Israel) and also countries with prolonged US presence (Afghanistan).
Furthermore, an analysis throught time showed the volatililty of aid and how its also shaped by domestic politics and responses to international events. 

Given the vastness of the dataset, more can still be analysed or compiled. All depending on the focus of the researcher's interest.
